With mortgage rates rising and housing prices continuing to climb, a new study finds Austin has the second most overpriced housing market.It found that based on historical trends, the average price of a home in Travis County in February 2022 should have been $347,775. Instead, the study found that the actual average price is $573,123. That’s 65% higher than where historical data shows they should be.The idea of this project is to do an in-depth analysis the Austin Housing Dataset through apprropriate Machine Learning models and predict the Austin house price for the year 2023.

## Deliverbale 1: Final Project Segment 1

### Presentation
Team members have drafted their project, including the following: 
1.Selected topic 
2.Reason why they selected their topic 
3.Description of their source of data 
4.Questions they hope to answer with the data

### GitHub

1.  Main Branch Includes a README.md 
2.  README.md README.md must include: Description of the communication protocols 
3.  Individual Branches 
	-   At least one branch for each team member 
	-   Each team member has at least four commits from the duration of the first segment 

Note: The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted.

### Machine Learning Model

Team members present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
-Takes in data in from the provisional database 
-Outputs label(s) for input data

### Database 
Team members present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following: 
-Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema 
-Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database 


## Reason why we selected the topic
    Low inventory, fervid competition and massive price gains have battered buyers since covid pandemic, but now rapidly rising mortgage rates are making it even harder to purchase an affordable home. For many buyers, higher mortgage rates mean they can no longer afford homes in specific price ranges.   The problem is that even modest single-family homes cost as much as lavish pads did a few years ago, so buyers are stuck either waiting for more inventory to come online or moving to a more affordable area. And there are many more who are hoping prices will drop—but that might not happen anytime soon.  And this gives us an opportunity to apply machine learning models to predict the prices of houses in the year 2023 based on the available features.
